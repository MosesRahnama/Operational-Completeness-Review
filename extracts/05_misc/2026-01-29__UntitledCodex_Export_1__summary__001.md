> \*\*Your Prompt:\*\*Can you tell me what's the difference between codex high, extra high Max, extra high? Sounds like, you know, kind of a fake label.
> \*\*AI Response:\*\*Good question. If you mean GPT5.1CodexMax (or its family GPT5.1Codex / Codex), then High, Extra High (xhigh) / Extra High Max, etc. are real  not fake  but *marketing-y & confusing* labels for different reasoning-effort / performance modes. Heres whats going on  told like it is 
> ** What those labels** ***mean***
> - **High (or Codex High):** A higher-accuracy mode that balances speed and quality: better reasoning than low/fast, but still relatively efficient for many tasks.
> - **Extra High / xhigh (or Extra High Max / xhigh Max):** The beefed-up mode of Codex-Max: it leans into depth and thoroughness of reasoning, using more thinking tokens, spending more time per task, and delivering more accurate, robust outputsat the cost of latency (i.e. slower responses / more compute).
> - **The Max in Codex-Max** generally refers to the full, long-horizon version of Codex: built to handle multi-file refactors, long sessions, big contexts, repeated iterations, and complex codebasesa different league than the original Codex.
