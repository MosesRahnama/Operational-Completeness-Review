> The KO7 operator-only rewrite calculus faces insurmountable theoretical barriers when
> attempting to achieve both computational completeness and logical consistency simultaneously.
> The eqW reflexive peak problem represents not a technical challenge to be solved, but a
> fundamental manifestation of deep mathematical limitations that pervade all sufficiently expressive
> computational systems.
> The theoretical landscape reveals why operator-only systems cannot
