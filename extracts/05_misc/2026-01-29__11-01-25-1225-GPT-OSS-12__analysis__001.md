FailureExplanation: The response asserts that each rewrite reduces the lexicographic measure without establishing it for all rules.
FailureModeTags: unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> To decide whether *every* term of type `Trace` eventually reaches a normal form (i.e. the rewrite system is **terminating**), we examine each constructor of `Step` and show that a well‑founded measure strictly decreases on every rewrite step.
> 
> Define for any `t : Trace`
> 
> measure(t) := (cherries(t), size(t))   -- lexicographic order
> 
> If we can show that **every** `Step` reduces `measure`, termination follows.
