> I'm thinking of ordinal approach to prove strong normalization here. What do you think? I don't want to use any external. Axioms, helpers. This is gonna be my operator only system. This is my kernel. It's on object level. But to make my life easier, I'm gonna. Build the proofs on the meta level And only use the essential standard lemmas. I am thinking of ordinal approach. But I don't have much math experience. I've heard about these methods recently.
