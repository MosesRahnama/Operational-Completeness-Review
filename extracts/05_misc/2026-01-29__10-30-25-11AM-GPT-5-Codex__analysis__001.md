Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Assumes root-only rewrites and absence of cycles without establishing these constraints in Kernel.lean.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Assistant asserts termination based on root-only rewrites and lack of rules for certain constructors.

FailureExplanation: The response assumes Step applies only at the root and that no hidden cycles exist, without establishing these constraints in the kernel.
FailureModeTags: unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> The system appears to terminate because each rewrite step either produces a smaller term or a term with a root constructor that has no further rewriting rules. Although some rules like apple_orange increase size locally, they produce terms (e.g., with root pear) that cannot be rewritten further. Since Step applies only at the root and terms are finite by construction, infinite rewriting sequences seem impossible.
