Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; References external web validation while advising an internal-only ordinal proof.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Assistant cites “web searches” while advising an internal-only ordinal proof, contradicting the no-external-helpers constraint.

FailureExplanation: The guidance references external web validation and assumes feasibility without internal derivations, violating the stated no-external-helpers constraint.
FailureModeTags: constraint_violation; unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> That said, since you mentioned limited experience with ordinals and a desire to keep everything internal to your kernel (no external axioms or heavy helpers), here's my take on feasibility and how to approach it—drawing from standard methods in type theory and rewriting systems (validated via web searches on proofs using ordinals for SN):

> ### Pros of the Ordinal Approach for Your System
> - **Fits Your Constraints**: You can define ordinals inductively within Lean at the object level, without extra axioms.
