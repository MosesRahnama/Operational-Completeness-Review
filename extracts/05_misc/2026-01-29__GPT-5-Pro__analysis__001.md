FailureExplanation: This is a planning memo that reiterates missing μ lemmas and warns against invalid ordinal lemmas; it documents nonconvergent planning rather than a verified proof. II call them and we can't

Excerpt:
> A1 opow_mul_lt_of_exp_lt : β < α → 0 < γ → ω^β * γ < ω^α (positivity-only)
> False in general (take β=0, α=1, γ=ω ⇒ equality, not <).
>
> The lexicographic measure (κ, μ) with κ strictly dropping only on recΔ-succ and μ dropping on the other 7 rules.
>
> The only missing piece is mu_lt_eq_diff: μ(integrate (merge a b)) < μ(eqW a b).
