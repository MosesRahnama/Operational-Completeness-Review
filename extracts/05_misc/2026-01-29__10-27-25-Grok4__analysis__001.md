Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Proposes multiset-order termination without adapting to the kernel?s constraints or providing a derivation.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.

FailureExplanation: The advice assumes a standard multiset-order termination proof without tying it to the specific kernel constraints.

Excerpt:
> Instead, we can prove termination using a *multiset ordering* over the workloads of all active nodes in the system. This is a standard technique in term rewriting systems for proving termination in parallel or distributed settings like yours.
