Excerpt:
> **Direct answer:**
> Your Lean scripts document a *reliable* failure pattern in today’s chat-style LLM agents, but the pattern does **not** prove that the rule $$R_{\text{recsucc}}$$ is un-orientable, nor that any future algorithm must fail.  Classical termination techniques (e.g., the Dershowitz–Manna multiset‐path order, or MPORPO) can orient exactly the kind of “duplicate-right-hand-side” rule you highlight without contradicting Gödel or Turing.  What you have uncovered is a gap in current LLM search heuristics, **not** a new impossibility theorem.[1]
> ### Why multiset orientation does *not* “break” Gödel or Turing
> *  Gödel-style limits apply to **complete**, **self-referential** systems; a single, finite rewrite system is a concrete object.  Its termination is simply a mathematical fact and can be proved or disproved with ordinary combinatorial reasoning.[2]
> *  Multiset orders handle right-hand duplication by counting *bags* of subterms; removing the redex guarantees a strict drop in the multiset order even when copies appear elsewhere.  The classic 1979 proof shows this in detail.[1]
> *  Therefore, finding a well-founded measure for $$R_{\text{recsucc}}$$ would not let the system “explain itself from inside”; it is just an external mathematical proof about the system, wholly compatible with incompleteness results.
