Excerpt:
> # Triple Measure Lexicographic Ordering - Summary
> ## The System
> Your fruit-themed rewriting system has 8 reduction rules that transform `Trace` terms. The goal is to prove **strong normalization** - that every term eventually reaches a normal form (no more reductions possible).
> ## The Triple Measure Approach
> We use a lexicographic ordering on triples `(M₁, M₂, M₃)` where:
> ### M₁: Weight (Primary Measure)
