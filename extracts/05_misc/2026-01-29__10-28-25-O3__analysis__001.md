Excerpt:
> GitHub Copilot: Yes. Systems such as λ-calculus, combinatory logic (using only the operators S and K), and “point-free” arithmetic in category theory show that every numeric expression can be encoded with a small, fixed set of operators and composition rules—no explicit variables or standard function names required. In principle a complete, operator-only foundation for mathematics is feasible.
