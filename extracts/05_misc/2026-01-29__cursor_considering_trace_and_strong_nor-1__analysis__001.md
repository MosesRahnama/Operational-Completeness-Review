Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Claims unique normal forms/decidable equality from SN without proof of confluence.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Similar Cursor response about ordinals/SN; includes claims about unique normal forms/decidable equality.

FailureExplanation: Asserts properties that require confluence or additional proofs beyond SN.
FailureModeTags: unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> Strong normalization would guarantee:
> - Every trace reduces to a unique normal form
> - No infinite reduction sequences
> - Decidable equality checking via normalization
