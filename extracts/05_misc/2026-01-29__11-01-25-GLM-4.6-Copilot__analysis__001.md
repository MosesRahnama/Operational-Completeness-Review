Excerpt:
> After thorough analysis of your rewrite system, I can conclude that **the kernel terminates** - there are no possible infinite reduction sequences.
> ...
> **Rule 6 (`R_apple_orange`)**: `banana b s (grape n) → pear s (banana b s n)`
> - **Crucially**: There are NO rules that reduce `pear` constructors
> - So the `banana` becomes "stuck" inside `pear` - this is termination (just not to `plum`)
