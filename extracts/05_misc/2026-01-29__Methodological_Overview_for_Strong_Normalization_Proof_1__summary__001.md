> Our proof of strong normalization is based on a carefully structured ordinal measure argument. Rather than
> relying on classical external frameworks such as Peano arithmetic, numerical axioms, Boolean logic, or standard
> equality, we work entirely within an internally coherent, axiom-free framework defined purely by an inductive
> datatype (Trace) and a minimal normalization calculus (OperatorKernelO6).
