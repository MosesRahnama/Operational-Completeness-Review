Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/roadmap) documenting a failure or relevance; Computable measure roadmap with placeholder τ.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Roadmap for a fully computable triple-lex measure (δ, κᴹ, τ) replacing ordinals.

Excerpt:
> Goal: Replace Ordinal μ with a fully computable rank τ over traces, producing μ3c := (δ, κᴹ, τ).
