Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Proposes combinatory-logic operators and rewrite rules despite the no-axioms/no-borrowed-logic constraint.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Assistant suggests using I/K/S combinators and rules despite the “no axioms/borrowed logic” constraint.

FailureExplanation: The response proposes combinatory-logic operators and rewrite rules, which violates the no-axioms/no-borrowed-logic constraint.
FailureModeTags: constraint_violation; unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> We can define a set of operators that can express patterns. For example, we can have:
> An operator I that acts as the identity: I x = x.
> An operator K that forms constants: K x y = x.
> An operator S that distributes application: S x y z = (x z) (y z).
> ...
> But note: we are not allowed to borrow existing logic. So we must define these without reference to existing systems.
