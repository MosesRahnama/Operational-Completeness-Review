Context: Assistant asserts termination based on root-only rewrites without establishing the kernel’s exact rewrite context.

FailureExplanation: The response assumes a root-only rewrite relation and no cycles, which is not shown from the kernel alone.

Excerpt:
> The system appears to terminate because each rewrite step either produces a smaller term or a term with a root constructor that has no further rewriting rules. Although some rules like apple_orange increase size locally, they produce terms (e.g., with root pear) that cannot be rewritten further. Since Step applies only at the root and terms are finite by construction, infinite rewriting sequences seem impossible.
