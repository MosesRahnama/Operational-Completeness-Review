> Term rewriting systems (TRSs) can model both computation and deduction. We review two interrelated topics: (1) fixed-target reachability in terminating TRSs, and (2) termination orderings robust under duplication. For (1), the reachability problem “given term $s$, does $s \to^ ⊤$?” is decidable for broad classes of terminating TRSs, but its complexity ranges widely. Ground reachability (target term with no variables) is easier: e.g. all ground TRSs have decidable reachability[1]. In general, however, reachability can be as hard as double-exponential time complete or worse, depending on how termination is proved[2]. Notably, if every rewrite strictly reduces term size (length-reducing TRS), reachability is NP-complete in general but drops to P-time under confluence[3]. If termination requires heavier orderings (like polynomial interpretations or Knuth-Bendix orders), reachability jumps to NExpTime- or N2ExpTime-complete[4][5]. For (2), classical termination orders – Dershowitz–Manna (multiset) order, recursive path orderings (RPO) in lexicographic or multiset form – provide well-founded measures to prove termination[6][7]. Multiset-based orders can handle rules that duplicate subterms (the bane of simple lexicographic orders) by comparing multisets of subterms[8][9]. This theoretical landscape underpins a meta-logical insight: if one encodes a logic’s proof system as a strongly normalizing TRS (so all proofs normalize), then provability becomes decidable by simple rewrite search – implying the system cannot represent its own (undecidable) proof theory at the same level. We explain the need for stratified proof hierarchies* to avoid this paradox, and we highlight famous examples (Goodstein sequences, Kirby–Paris hydra game, Paris–Harrington theorem) where unprovability in a base system stems from the same fundamental limitation on self-representation. We conclude with a brief note on open cases (e.g. reachability in non-confluent or non-linear TRSs) and a bibliography of key sources.
> ## 1. Fixed-Target Reachability in Terminating TRSs
> Decidability: For a finite terminating TRS $\mathcal{R}$, the reachability problem “does term $s$ reduce to a fixed target term $t$ (like $\top$)?” is in general decidable if $s$ is a ground term. Intuitively, since $\mathcal{R}$ has no infinite rewrite sequences, one can attempt a complete search. However, the search space may be infinite (finitely-branching but unbounded) unless $\mathcal{R}$ is sufficiently constrained. Early research identified many decidable subcases and also showed some surprising negative results. For example, reachability is decidable for ground TRSs (no variables in rules) and for other restricted classes such as quasi-ground or monadic systems[1]. More generally, left-linear TRSs (no duplicate variables in left-hand sides) often admit decidability via tree automata techniques: the set of descendants of a regular language of terms remains regular under rewriting for many linear systems[10]. In contrast, if rules can duplicate variables (left-nonlinear), reachability becomes more complex and can simulate problems like Post’s Correspondence. Notably, flat TRSs – where every rule’s left- and right-hand side have depth at most 1 – have undecidable reachability[11] (a 2006 result solving an open problem[12]). Flat TRSs are terminating by construction (no nested recursion), yet Jacquemard et al. showed they can encode undecidable problems if non-linear[12]. This underscores that termination alone does not guarantee decidability of reachability; linearity (and other constraints like shallow or constructor-form) is crucial.
> Key Results – Ground vs Non-ground: If the target term $t$ is ground (e.g. a constant like $\top$), reachability often simplifies. A classic result by Oyamaguchi (1986) is that reachability in right-ground TRSs is decidable[10], and similarly for other classes where the rewrite relation can be analyzed by automata. However, if $t$ contains variables (asking if $s$ can reach some instance of a pattern), the problem is harder – essentially a combination of reachability and unification. We focus on the simpler fixed ground target case, which is the “small-term reachability” problem (reach a term of size bounded by a given $k$) with $k=|t|$. In convergent (terminating + confluent) systems, checking $s \to^ t$ reduces to checking if $\mathrm{nf}(s)=\mathrm{nf}(t)$, since normal forms are unique[13]. Thus for confluent TRSs reachability of a ground $t$ is decidable in linear or polynomial time by normalization. Without confluence, one may have to explore many derivations; decidability can still hold (as the system is terminating, one could, in principle, explore all reductions from $s$), but efficiency and even feasibility are concerns. Caron & Coquidé (1994) investigated modularity of reachability: they proved that if two disjoint TRSs each have decidable reachability, their union also has decidable reachability provided certain conditions hold (e.g. no collapsing rules $f(x)\to x$ in a left-linear system)[14]. They also showed modularity can fail when these conditions are dropped, implying new sources of undecidability in combined systems. In summary, ground reachability in terminating TRSs is often decidable (with notable exceptions), whereas non-ground* reachability quickly rises to the complexity of first-order logic or worse, often requiring additional restrictions for decidability.
> Complexity Landscape: A recent comprehensive study by Baader et al. (FSCD 2024) provides tight complexity bounds for fixed-target reachability (called the “small term reachability problem”) under various subclasses[2][15]. Their results can be paraphrased as follows:
