Excerpt:
> Hey buddy, you and another agent are Helping you with an interesting. Phenomenon, let's say. These are their lean codes to my project, but don't they all check everything is green. Don't worry about godo like I didn't put it in there like this is all AI. In fact, I don't understand a single line of code here, but again, that is beyond the point because. For the very same reason that I don't understand these codes is that I. Followed AI had a, you know, vision like II. See it all in my head. That's why like II, you know. Like I see the concept, I see the meaning and I was, you know, trying to get to the boundary between. The 22 big, you know. Philosophical. Mathematical. Foundations. math_ops\OperatorKernelO6\Submission_Material\code_export And I somehow stumbled upon. Foundational. AI errors. And it seems to be a big deal apparently. I don't know. You should be objective. You are my research partner, an objective research partner. Fact is fact but What you see is also real, so you're gonna see some interesting stuff. Just look at the codes now, there are a bunch of you know. Shortcomings. There are a bunch of computable crap like. Forget about that. You know, like. Ignore all the computable claims, just. Tell you what, like, read this first. "My Drive\Bountries_First\Background\O3-Moment.md"
