Purpose: Evidence extract (misc/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Claims unique normal forms and decidable equality from SN without establishing confluence or normalization-by-evaluation.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Assistant asserts unique normal forms and decidable equality from SN without proof.

Excerpt:
> ## Strong Normalization Benefits
> 
> Your `Step` relation defines a reduction system. Strong normalization would guarantee:
> - Every trace reduces to a unique normal form
> - No infinite reduction sequences (critical for a computer system!)
> - Decidable equality checking via normalization
