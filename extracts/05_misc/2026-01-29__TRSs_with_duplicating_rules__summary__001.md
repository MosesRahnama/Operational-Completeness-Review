> Selected TRSs (TPDB) – We choose ten TRSs with duplicating rules (variables occur more often on RHS) or
> base-change rules (constructor/head-symbol changes), including classic hard cases from SK90 and D33
> and two relative TRSs. The table below summarizes the results. All runs used TTT2 (120s timeout) and
> AProVE, with CeTA validating each CPF proof. (For two cases, we also independently certified the proof via
> CiME3 by generating a Coq script and compiling it
> – indicated in notes.) All CPF proofs were accepted
> by CeTA. (In early competitions, some proofs contained unsupported steps (e.g. replacing 0-arity symbols with
