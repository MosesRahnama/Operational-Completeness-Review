Context: Verification shows the weight measure increases on R_apple_orange due to duplication of s.

FailureExplanation: The duplication in R_apple_orange makes the weight measure increase for large s, so the proposed measure does not prove termination.
FailureModeTags: nondecreasing_measure

Excerpt:
> **DUPLICATION DETECTED**: Subterm `s` appears once on LHS but twice on RHS!

> **FAILURE**: 210 > 200! The measure INCREASES!
