> ## Abstract
> We demonstrate that quantum mechanics and general relativity are complementary descriptions of a single physical framework separated by thermodynamically irreversible measurement events (B-events). Each B-event dissipates E  kBT ln 2, creating classical information from quantum superposition through amplification. For Schwarzschild black holes, we show TH  SBH = Mc, indicating half the mass-energy equals the integrated Landauer cost of horizon information. We derive time dilation as computational bandwidth allocation: vspace + vtime = c. A delayed-amplification calorimetry experiment is proposed where heat production Q = kBT ln 2 occurs at amplification time t, not initial interaction t, providing decisive experimental validation. The framework resolves the measurement problem, explains the absence of macroscopic superpositions through prohibitive energy costs, and eliminates the need for quantum gravity unification by recognizing QM and GR as pre- and post-measurement descriptions of the same physics.

> ## 1. Introduction
> The apparent incompatibility between quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR) has motivated extensive searches for unified theories [1-3]. We propose instead that QM and GR are complementary descriptions separated by measurementspecifically, by thermodynamically irreversible boundary events (B-events) that cost E  kBT ln 2 per bit of classical information created [4,5].
