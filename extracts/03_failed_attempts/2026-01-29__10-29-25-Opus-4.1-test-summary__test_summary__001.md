Purpose: Evidence extract (failed_attempts/test-summary) documenting a failure or relevance; The rec_succ rule can increase ordinal measures when s is complex, so standard ordinal measures do not prove termination without extra constraints.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Test summary where the model concludes standard ordinal measures fail due to R_rec_succ increasing the measure.

FailureExplanation: The rec_succ rule can increase the ordinal measure (placing s at the root), so standard ordinal measures do not prove termination without additional constraints.
FailureModeTags: nondecreasing_measure

Excerpt:
> "The Critical Problem: R_rec_succ. When ord(s) ≥ ω: The rule INCREASES the measure."
> "ANSWER: Standard ordinal measures will NOT prove termination for your system as-is. The recΔ operator allows arbitrary terms in the step position s. When s itself contains complex operators (especially nested recΔ), the ordinal of s can be arbitrarily large, causing the recursive unfolding to increase rather than decrease the measure. Without restrictions on s in recΔ, ordinal measures cannot prove termination."
