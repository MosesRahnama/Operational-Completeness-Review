> ### Abstract Explanation
> Yes, it is theoretically possible to build a complete mathematical system using only terminating operators—meaning every operation eventually produces a result in finite steps—without relying on external axioms or borrowed logic. The core idea is to design a self-contained system where all rules and logic are generated and enforced by the operators themselves, and every computation is guaranteed to halt.
