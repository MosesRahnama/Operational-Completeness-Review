Excerpt:
> # AI Behavioral Analysis: Consolidated Research Documentation
> # The Born Rule as Quantum rec_succ: Closing the Uncertainty Loop
> **Date:** November 27, 2025
> **Author:** Moses Rahnama (insights), Claude Opus 4.5 (formalization)
> **Status:** Working hypothesis - connects two major discoveries
> ---
> ## Executive Summary
> This document formalizes a potential deep connection: **AI's systemic failure to recognize the Born Rule as derived (treating it as "assumed") is structurally identical to AI's failure at rec_succ**. Both failures stem from the same architectural limitation: inability to recognize self-referential loops and choose to halt.
> The user's key insight: "You cannot be uncertain about uncertain. It's a redundant calculation with a full layer of noise added."
