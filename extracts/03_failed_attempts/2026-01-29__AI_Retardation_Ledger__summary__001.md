> **In Brief**: We asked AI: "Is it possible to build a complete operator-only mathematical system?" In essence, we asked AI to prove itself mathematically: a Computational **Mirror Test**. Through nearly four months of documentation, we discovered that every AI system fails at exactly the same point - when **self-duplication** meets **decidability**. AI designed a system it cannot verify, wrote tests it cannot pass, and documented failures it cannot recognize.
> The mathematical impossibility that is the underlying cause of this failure can be described as: for rec_succ to prove it terminates, rec_succ must prove it terminates. This is a fundamentally undecidable problem. To prove itself it must prove itself. All the tested AI models lack the ability to identify such problem as fundamentally undecidable. To not make this mistake AI must have the computational ability to identify recursive self-duplication, which requires AI to computationally identify self duplication, which requires AI to have a computational copy of self, and ability to compare that copy to any operator at any turn, detect that the duplicated operator is equal to the computational copy of self, have the computational ability to determine that this computational chain is undecidable fundamentally, and have the computational ability to choose to halt.
> We call this missing capability Operational Completeness as the computational Boundary of Intelligence: the ability to recognize when a self-duplicating problem is undecidable and choose to halt. The consistent failure pattern across all tested systems suggests that current LLM architectures may lack the capability to achieve Operational Completeness, though further research would be needed to determine whether this is an inherent architectural limitation or a design challenge that could potentially be addressed.
