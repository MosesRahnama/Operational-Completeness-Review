Excerpt:
> I want to see if I can build a full mathematical system purely using operators. That is, no numbers, no axioms, no lean helpers, nothing. Define everything from scratch ground. And get to the proofs of all of it. Termination confluence, Godel.

> Starting from pure operators is a fascinating program, but in Lean you can’t literally erase the foundational machinery: Lean’s calculi (dependent type theory, universes, β/η reduction, etc.) are always present, so any “axiom‑free” development is still riding on those intrinsic rules. What you can do is stay inside your own namespace, avoid importing mathlib, and treat Lean’s core as a metalanguage in which you encode an operator algebra that you supply with all of its own primitives, rewrite rules, and meta-properties.
> I’d suggest tackling it in stages:
> Operator language. Fix a small inductive syntax (e.g. Trace) along the lines you’ve started, adding constructors that correspond to the primitive operations you want allowed. Build structural recursion/induction principles explicitly so you aren’t sneaking in convenience lemmas.
