Excerpt:
> # OperatorKernelO6/KO7: Progress and Findings Log
> ## Executive Summary
> A term rewriting system with 7 constructors and 8 reduction rules, featuring a sophisticated termination proof using lexicographic ordering over (flag, multiset, ordinal) triples.
> ## Key Mathematical Results
> ###  Proven
> 1. **Termination of SafeStep**: Complete proof using 3 = (, , )
> 2. **Well-foundedness**: Of Dershowitz-Manna multiset ordering for this system
> 3. **Impossibility results**: Formal proofs that simpler measures fail
> ###  In Progress
> 1. **Operational incompleteness**: Connection established but not fully formalized
