> # The Deep Mathematics of rec_succ: Why AI Fails Even When It Sees The Problem
> ## Part A: Why AI Fails DESPITE Seeing Complexity Increase
> ### The Paradox: AI Can Calculate But Can't Conclude
> When AI analyzes rec_succ, it CORRECTLY calculates:
> ```
> Before: M(rec b s (delta n)) = b + s + n + 2
> After:  M(app s (rec b s n)) = 2s + b + n + 2
> Increase: +s
> ```
> AI sees this! It writes: "The measure increases by s"
