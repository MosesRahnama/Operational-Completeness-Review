Excerpt:
> Investigate the "duplication blindness" problem in automated
> termination proofs:
> 1. Find documented cases where AI systems or automated provers fail to
> correctly handle duplicating rules in term rewriting systems.
> Specifically, where additive measures fail due to the identity
> M(after) = M(before) - 1 + M(S) when M(S)  1.
> 2. Research the current state of Dershowitz-Manna multiset ordering
> implementations. What tools exist (CiME, AProVE, TTT2, etc.) and what
> are their known limitations when AI generates the termination
> arguments?
