Excerpt:
> UNDAMENTAL RESEARCH CHALLENGE: Axiom-Free Operator-Based Gdelian System
> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Design and prove a complete operator-based formal system capable of encoding arithmetic, logic, and self-reference(sufficient for Gdel's incompleteness theorems) using ONLY:
> - Primitive operators (no external axioms)
> - Syntactic reduction rules (no semantic predicates)
> - Provable termination for ALL rules
> - No meta-level dependencies
> ---
>  STRICT EXECUTION CONTRACT (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)
> CONTRACT: You MUST obey these gates or explicitly declare CONSTRAINT BLOCKER
> A) Branch-by-branch rfl gate
