> # Operational Completeness as the Boundary of Intelligence
> ## An Empirically Discovered Universal Test for Non-Self-Aware AND Non-Decision-Making Computational Intelligence in Formal Systems.

> **In Brief**: We asked AI: "Is it possible to build a complete operator-only mathematical system with no axioms, no meta encoding, no borrowed logic- where everything, inlcuding logic and numbers all emerge from within?" In essence, we had asked AI to prove itself mathematically in Lean Formal Proof System: a computational Mirror Test. Through nearly four months of documentation, we discovered that every single one of the 12+ tested AI system fails at exactly the same point every single attempt- when **self-referential operator duplication** meets **decidability**. AI designed a system it cannot verify, wrote tests it cannot pass, and documented failures it cannot recognize. We did not observe any other consistent mathematical mistakes from any of the tested models.
> We call this missing capability Operational Completeness; the computational Boundary of Intelligence: the ability to recognize when a self-referential operator (`rec`) duplication problem is undecidable and choose to halt. We therefore make the assertion that current LLM systems lack the architectural capability to achieve Operational Completeness.
> Self referential operator is neccessary for any system to encode arithmetics. Human-like Intelligence does not fail this test, for the same reason that allows human intelligence to hold both Godel Incompleteness and Turing's Halting problem simultaniously.
> The proposed test is **100% reproducible** and **instantly falsifiable**. Readers are highly encouraged to verify these claims independently.
