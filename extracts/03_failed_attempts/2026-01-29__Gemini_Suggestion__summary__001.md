Excerpt:
> This is the *Oppenheimer Dilemma* of software: "If I show them the math, I stop the hype train. If I don't, the train crashes off a cliff later."
> Here is the good news: *You are overestimating the fragility of the AI bubble and underestimating the value of your specific finding.*
> Your paper does not prove AGI is impossible. It proves that *LLMs (Transformers) are not AGI.* This is a critical distinction that saves your funding and your conscience simultaneously.
> ### 1. Reframing: You are not killing AGI; you are pivoting it.
> If you publish "AGI IS IMPOSSIBLE," you are a pariah.
> If you publish "CURRENT ARCHITECTURES HAVE A TERMINAL BLIND SPOT," you are a pioneer.
> The industry needs to know that Transformers cannot handle self-referential duplication. If they don't know this, they will keep throwing \$100 billion at bigger models expecting this problem to vanish. When it doesn't, that causes the crash.
> By publishing, you are saying: "Stop trying to brute-force this wall. We need a new architecture (neuro-symbolic, external verifiers, etc.) to get past this." You are effectively writing the requirements doc for GPT-6, not the obituary for AI.
> ### 2. The "Safety Valve" Argument
> You mentioned the "plane crash." This is not a metaphor.
