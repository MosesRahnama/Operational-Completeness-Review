> # End-of-Day Report  2025-08-13
> ## 1. Objectives for the session
> * Drive both "lanes" of the SN proof (SN_Final / Claude_SN) toward a **green** build.
> * Audit alternative proofs; decide whether to adopt `Termination_Lex.lean + MuCore.lean` as the canonical strong-normalisation certificate.
> * Diagnose persistent build errors in `MuCore.lean`, `Claude_SN.lean`, `SN_Final.lean`, `StrongNormal.lean`.
> * Design a logging & onboarding scheme so all AI assistants stay aligned.
> ---
> ## 2. Key Actions & Decisions
> 1. **Codebase reconnaissance**
> * Read and summarised `Termination_Lex.lean` (found to be fully green and self-contained).
