> Opinion 1:
> ## 1 Adopt S1 (rec+eqW). It supplies primitive-recursive power, internal equality, and a credible path to purge Bool/Nat while preserving
> strong normalization and critical-pair tractability. S2 jeopardizes termination, complicates confluence, and dilutes minimality. Focus
> resources on lemmas L1L9, then revisit minimization needs; defer  until SN proof secured.
