> # OperatorKernelO6 Project Bible

> ## 1. Kernel Specification & Sacred Rules
> ### 1.1 Project Philosophy: Axiom-Free Procedural Truth
> The OperatorKernelO6 project is a minimalist computational foundation where arithmetic, logic, and self-reference arise *internally* from the normalization of a single inductive datatype, `Trace`.
> -   **Axiom Freedom:** The system uses no external logical or arithmetic schemes. There are no Peano axioms, no primitive Booleans, and no imported equality axioms.
> -   **Procedural Truth:** A proposition is considered "true" if and only if its representation as a `Trace` deterministically normalizes to the `void` constructor. Truth is a computational outcome, not a postulated value.
> -   **Emergence:** Core mathematical and logical concepts are not primitives but emerge from the rewrite geometry:
> -   **Numerals:** Emerge as chains of `delta` applications (`-chains`).
> -   **Negation:** Emerges from the cancellation dynamics of `integrate` and `merge`.
