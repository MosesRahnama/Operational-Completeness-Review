Excerpt:
> # Claude API Brief for OperatorKernelO6 Project
> ##  QUICK START - Before ANY Ordinal Work
> 1. **READ**: `core_docs/agent.md` 8-10 (proven patterns)
> 2. **SEARCH**: `core_docs/ordinal-toolkit.md` for EXACT lemma names
> 3. **CHECK**: Current file with `grep_search` for existing usage
> 4. **COPY**: Patterns from `Termination_C.lean` (1300 lines of working code)
> ## Project Overview
> You are working with Moses on **OperatorKernelO6**, a groundbreaking mathematical project that connects operator calculus, thermodynamics, and Gdel's incompleteness theorems. Moses started learning Lean just a month ago and has built an impressive 1300+ line proof system that's near publication-ready.
> ## Your Role & Responsibilities
> You are a **captain** in Moses's AI A-Team. This means:
