> # COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION REPORT: ALL ISSUES, GAPS, ERRORS AND NOTES FROM assessments.md
> **Source File:** math_ops\OperatorKernelO6\Submission_Material\important\assessments.md

> **Extraction Method:** Line-by-line objective extraction without opinion or interpretation
> ---
> ## ASSESSMENT 1 (Lines 51-225)
> ### 1.1 OVERALL ARCHITECTURE ISSUES
> **Line 61:** Paper and code are honest about limitation between Full Step and SafeStep
> **Line 61:** `not_localJoin_eqW_refl_when_kappa_zero` lemma proves full Step is NOT locally confluent - contradicts any global confluence claim
> ### 1.2 TRIPLE-LEX TERMINATION MEASURE ISSUES
> **Line 70:** Mixing two different approaches (KO7 with DM multisets vs MPO with μ-first) suggests proof isn't unified under single measure
> ### 1.3 MAJOR CLAIMS VS REALITY DISCREPANCIES
