FailureExplanation: Analyzes duplication and κ-measure failures, indicating additive measures cannot strictly decrease under recΔ duplication.
FailureModeTags: nondecreasing_measure; unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> I'll tackle this systematically. Let me first analyze the failure modes of previous approaches, then explore potential breakthrough avenues with the mandatory verification protocol.
