> # The rec_succ Differential Diagnostic

> ## Executive Summary
> This document formalizes a discovery: **AI systems cannot correctly predict their own token output length**, and this failure is mathematically guaranteed by the same rec_succ structure that prevents AI from achieving Operational Completeness. Combined with confidence score analysis, this creates an unfakeable two-probe diagnostic that detects operational incompleteness in real-time without alerting the system under test.
> **The Jackpot Insight**: Confidence scores can be faked through consistent output patterns, but token count predictions cannot be faked because they require knowing the future output before generating it.
