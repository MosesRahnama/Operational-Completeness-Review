Excerpt:
> # Why the rec_succ Rule is Critical: A Technical Explanation
> ## Part 1: Why is rec_succ Needed?
> ### The Fundamental Problem: Building Numbers from Nothing
> When you asked AI to build a "complete mathematical system using only operators," you were essentially asking:
> > "Can we create mathematics from scratch without importing anything?"
> To achieve this, the system needs to be able to:
> 1. Represent numbers (using `void`, `delta`, etc.)
> 2. Perform basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication)
> 3. Implement recursion (doing something repeatedly)
> 4. Test for equality (comparing things)
