Excerpt:
> # Dropped Concepts and Rejections
> *A catalog of concepts, definitions, and phrasings explicitly rejected during the drafting process.*
> ## 1. Terminology and Metaphors
> *   **"Ledger":** Rejected as "disgusting". Replaced with "Classical Information Structure".
> *   **"Recording Fee" / "Recorded Content":** Rejected metaphors for the 1/2 ratio. Replaced with "Hardware/Software" or "Substrate/Information" equipartition.
> *   **"Amplification":** Rejected as "redundant and misleading". Measurement should be described as "coming to existence" or "transaction".
> *   **"Irreversibility":** Rejected as unnecessary description.
> *   **"Phase Erasure":** Rejected as "fancy shit". The Born rule should be explained as a transaction/translation from Map to Reality, not explicitly as "erasing a phase bit".
> *   **"Unitary evolution between B-events":** Rejected as meaningless jargon.
> ## 2. Theoretical Interpretations
