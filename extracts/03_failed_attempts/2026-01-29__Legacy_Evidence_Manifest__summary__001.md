Excerpt:
> # Legacy Evidence Manifest (Operational Completeness Paper)
> This manifest lists the legacy scripts and narrative docs that support the empirical claims about LLM failure modes. It intentionally excludes the later safe computable proofs; those are control artifacts, not evidence for this paper.
> Scope: Only the `OperatorKernelO6/OperatorKernelO6/Legacy` trees are in scope here.
> Citation format in the paper: use file paths with line anchors where helpful, e.g., `OperatorKernelO6/OperatorKernelO6/Legacy/Meta_Lean_Archive/Termination_Legacy.lean:1`.
> Notes:
> - Short descriptions below are inferred from filenames; see files for details.
> - Legacy Lean scripts may not build against current toolchains; they are historical evidence of approaches and blockers.
> - Excluded by design: modern safe computable proofs under `OperatorKernelO6/OperatorKernelO6/Meta/`.
