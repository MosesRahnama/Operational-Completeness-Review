Purpose: Evidence extract (failed_attempts/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Diagnostic explains AI detects measure increase under rec_succ but lacks a halt mechanism.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Deep analysis of rec_succ failure dynamics in AI reasoning.
