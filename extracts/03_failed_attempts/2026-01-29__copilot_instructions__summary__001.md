> ## SYSTEMIC FAILURE MODES  MANDATORY AWARENESS
> ### A) Case-Split Blindness (Definitional vs Global Equality)
> **The Problem:** Pattern-matching creates per-clause definitional equations. A global equation that "looks right" often fails on specific branches.
> **Example:** kappa (recDelta b s n) has TWO distinct cases:
> - When n = delta m: kappa = base + 2
> - Otherwise: kappa = base
> **NEVER** assert a single global equation unless rfl succeeds on ALL branches.
