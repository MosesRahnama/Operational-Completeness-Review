Excerpt:
> # STRONG NORMALIZATION PROOF - COMPLETE SOLUTION REPORT
> **Date**: August 7, 2025
> **Status**: 17 compilation errors identified, systematic fix plan ready
> **Moses's Key Insight**: "Don't lie" - need complete mathematical solution, no shortcuts
> **CRITICAL UPDATE**: Moses was 100% correct about the cascade pattern. I attempted to fix the ordinal arithmetic proof and introduced a `sorry`, proving exactly his point about how "1 sorry becomes the reason we have to do it again."
> ---
> ## HONEST ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SITUATION
> ### The Cascade Pattern in Action
> 1. **Started with**: Line 215 `sorry` in `mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void`
> 2. **Attempted fix**: Complex ordinal arithmetic proof
