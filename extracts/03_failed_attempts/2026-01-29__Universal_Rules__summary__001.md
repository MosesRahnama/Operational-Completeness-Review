Excerpt:
> # OperatorKernelO6  UNIVERSAL RULES (Primer + Full Protocol)
> This single document supersedes previous separate "Universal_Primer.md" and "Consolidated_General_Rules.md" files. It merges the firstread orientation (mission, invariants, layer boundaries) with the exhaustive universal rules, protocols, pitfalls, and provenance. All prior content is preserved verbatim or structurally embedded; no normative rule text has been removed.
