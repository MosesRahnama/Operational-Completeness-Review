Purpose: Evidence extract (failed_attempts/proof-attempt) documenting a failure or relevance; The proof contains an admit and uses heavy automation (norm_num/linarith), so the ?-based SN proof is incomplete.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Excerpt showing an admitted subgoal in the Φ-based rec_succ proof (Lean source).

FailureExplanation: The proof contains an admit and uses heavy automation (norm_num/linarith), so the Φ-based SN proof is incomplete.
