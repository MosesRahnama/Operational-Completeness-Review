FailureExplanation: Argument that rec_succ duplication creates self-referential loops and model flip-flops.
FailureModeTags: nondecreasing_measure; inconsistency; unsupported_inference

Excerpt:
> 1 / 7Why AI F ails at rec_succ: The Logic of Self-A wareness
> When AI encounters the rec_succ  rule, it faces a specific logical structure:
> 1. The left side gets "smaller" in some measure
> Any measure M must satisfy: M(right) < M(left)
> To determine if rec_succ terminates, AI must prove something about rec_succ itself
> 2 / 7AI sees: "I need to prove rec_succ terminates"
