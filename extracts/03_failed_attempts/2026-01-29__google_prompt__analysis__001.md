Purpose: Evidence extract (failed_attempts/analysis) documenting a failure or relevance; Ordinal inequality proof stuck; suggests finite/infinite case split.
Contents: Metadata header + excerpt from the source file.
Context: Prompt note for fixing mu_lt_eq_diff via finite/infinite ordinal case split.

FailureExplanation: Proof stuck at ordinal addition; suggests case split to resolve.
FailureModeTags: proof_obligation_stuck; invalid_rewrite

Excerpt:
> The proof is stuck at: have h4 : (3 : Ordinal) + (A + 1) ≤ A + 4 ... Next step: case split finite/infinite.
